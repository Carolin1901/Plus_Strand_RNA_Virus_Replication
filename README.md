# Mathematical modeling of plus-strand RNA virus replication

## Aim of this project
We developed mathematical model for the intracellular plus-strand RNA virus replication to study pan-viral simularities and virus-specific differences in the viral lifecylces of hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, and coxsackievirus B3.  

## Data and models

Model fitting and profile likelihood analysis have been performed by using the [Data2Dynamics toolbox]( https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/21/3558/195191) for the MATLAB environment (MATLAB 2016b) and hence, the structure of model folders follows that toolbox structure. Please see for more information the GitHub page and all references within ([Data2Dynamics GitHub](https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d)).

The folder structure for a model contains a *data*, *models* subfolder and *Setup* scripts. Run the model by executing the *Setup* script. 

## Results and plots
Plotting has been performed with R.
